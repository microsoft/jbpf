# Introduction

Userspace eBPF instrumentation and control framework for deploying control and monitoring functions in a secure manner. It is part of [Project Janus](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/programmable-ran-platform/) and provides probes for eBPF-like functionality outside of the Linux kernel.


# Architectural overview

![Architectural overview](docs/jbpf_oss_architecture.png)

The overall jbpf architecture is shown in the figure above. It consists of the following main components:
* **Application**: It is a user-provided executable that we want to instrument and control, built so that it is linked with the libjbpf library.
* **jbpf library**: The library that provides the functionality of deploying and executing codeletes, sending output data (output API) and receiving control data (input API).
* **Management framework**: This a framework to load/unload codelets (*codelet life-cycle management* and *secure codelet store*), collect telemetry and excert control (*data collection and control*) and build and deploy codelets (*codelet management*).

jbpf is not prescriptive in how the management framework should be built. It provides several APIs in the form of libraries: [`libjbpf_lcm`](docs/life_cycle_management.md) (life-cycle management), [`libjbpf_io`](docs/data_io.md) (input and output API) and [`libjbpf_verifier`](docs/verifier.md) (extended verifier), and a sample implementation of the management framework using the APIs. It expects that each user will use the APIs to integrate jbpf into their own prodution environment. 

For a high-level overview of the framework functionality, please read [this](./docs/overview.md). 



# Getting started

To build the library, [install the dependencies](./docs/dependencies.md), and run the following:
```
source ./setup_jbpf_env.sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```
Check [here](./CMakeLists.txt) to see build options. 

Then follow [these](./examples/first_example_standalone/README.md) steps to run a simple example and read [here](./docs/understand_first_codelet.md) to understand the example better.
Other variants of this example can be found [here](./examples/first_example_ipc/) and [here](./examples/reverse_proxy/).

## Doxygen documentation
You can generate the documentation using Doxygen. To do so, run the following:
```
make doc
```

The documentation will be generated in the `$OUT_DIR/docs/html` directory.

The paper is focused on 5G RAN instrumentation, but most concepts extend to arbitrary applications.
